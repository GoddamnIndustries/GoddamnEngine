Goddamn Engine
==============
_Copyright (C) Goddamn Industries 2011 - 2016. All Rights Reserved._

The [GoddamnEngine](http://goddamnengine.com) is cross-platform next-generation-ready computational and visualisation engine. Goal of this project is the creation of the most minimalistic full-featured game visualisation framework that surpasses most scientific engines. Project contains a very small core, but is intended to be very flexible and extensible.
Work is in progress now.

Features
--------
 - Minimalistic but flexible code design: engine is not as monstrous and clumsy piece of code as the others are.
 - Support of the most modern platforms: Windows (Phone & RT), OS X & iOS, Linux & Android, XBox One & PlayStation4, HTML5 (via Emscripten).
 - Advanced and modern rendering pipeline: DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal.
 - Entirely written in native languages: C++14, Objective-C++.

Installation
------------
 - Download [**the source code**](https://github.com/GoddamnIndustries/GoddamnEngine). You can do it by forking the official repository on GitHub.
 - Download and unzip to the engine location [**the required dependencies**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fz01ocjms3srtn3/GoddamnEngine-Dependencies.zip?dl=0) files. Replace files on prompt.
 - Perform next platform-dependent steps to finish installation.

### Windows.
 - Make sure you have [Visual Studio 2015 / 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/) installed. 2013 edition requires additional C++ compiler set, the [Visual C++ Compiler November 2013 CTP](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41151).
 - Run the **SetupGoddamnSDK.bat** inside the _GoddamnEngine_ directory. It should take less than a minute to generate the project files.

### OS X & Linux.
 - Make sure you have [Mono Development Kit (MDK)](http://www.mono-project.com/) installed.
 - Execute from a terminal **SetupGoddamnSDK.sh** inside the _GoddamnEngine_ directory. It should take less than a minute to generate the project files.
